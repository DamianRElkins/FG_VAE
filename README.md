Getting Started:
There is an environment.yml file which should help to set up the conda environment.

Dataset and all later forms of the dataset are stored within the data/ directory. 

dataset_creation.ipynb gets functional groups and scaffolds for all molecules, should work by running all cells.

curation.ipynb creates the smaller curated version of the dataset which is used in small_vae.ipynb.

fg_funcs.py contains helper functions for all other files.
